## Running the Notebooks
You can either run the notebook using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html), or on your local machine.

### Running on Binder or Colab
The simplest way to interact with a Jupyter Notebook is through
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aladinor/Ladino_et_al_2024_DNN_PSD_retrieval/main) or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aladinor/Ladino_et_al_2024_DNN_PSD_retrieval/blob/main), which enables the execution of a
Jupyter Book in the cloud. You’ll be able to execute
and even change the example programs. The data will be **automatically downloaded** when you open a notebook in Colab. You’ll see that the code cells
have no output at first, until you execute them by pressing
`Shift` `Enter`. Complete details on how to interact with
a live Jupyter notebook are described in [Getting Started with
Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html).

### Running on Your Own Machine
If you are interested in running this material locally on your computer, you will need to follow this workflow:

1. Clone the ["dnn-pds-retrieval"](https://github.com/aladinor/Ladino_et_al_2024_DNN_PSD_retrieval) repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aladinor/Ladino_et_al_2024_DNN_PSD_retrieval.git
    ```

2. Move into the `dnn-pds-retrieval` directory
    ```bash
    cd Ladino_et_al_2024_DNN_PSD_retrieval
    ```

3. Create and activate your conda environment from the `environment.yml` file
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate psd-retrievals
    ```

4.  Move into the `notebooks` directory and start up Jupyterlab
    ```bash
    cd notebooks/
    jupyter lab
    ```
